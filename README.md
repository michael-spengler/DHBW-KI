# DHBW Learning Apps
This repository connects learning apps which have been developed by DHBW students as Open Source Projects.  

The [training data](https://github.com/michael-spengler/DHBW-Learning-Apps/blob/main/training-data.md) is a key common ressource which is used by most of those learning- and exploration apps. 

## Learning Flavours

## Contribute
The quality of most of the mentioned DHBW Learning Apps is mainly influenced by the quality of the underlying [training data](https://github.com/michael-spengler/DHBW-Learning-Apps/blob/main/training-data.md).  
Every lecturer is invited to 
1. Fork this repository  
2. Optimize the [training data](https://github.com/michael-spengler/DHBW-Learning-Apps/blob/main/training-data.md) 
3. Raise a Pull Request to ensure the changes come back to this main DHBW training Data Repository
  
The plan is to have one [training data file](https://github.com/michael-spengler/DHBW-Learning-Apps/blob/main/training-data.md) across several study paths to support interdisciplinary exploration and collaboration.
