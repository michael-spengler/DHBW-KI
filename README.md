# DHBW Learning Apps
This repository connects learning apps which have been developed by DHBW students as Open Source Projects.  

The [training data](https://github.com/michael-spengler/DHBW-Learning-Apps/blob/main/training-data.md) is a key common ressource which is used by most of those learning- and exploration apps. 

## Learning Flavours

### Flashcards based Learning
[Fancy Flashcard App](https://github.com/fancy-flashcard/ffc#readme)

### Chatbot based Learning
[Telegram Bot](https://t.me/fancy_flashcard_bot)  
[Client Only Chatbot](https://michael-spengler.github.io/DHBW-Learning-Apps/)  

### Audio Chatbot based Learning
[Audio DHBW Chatbot](https://michael-spengler.github.io/DHBW-Learning-Apps/) (under construction)

### Study Group based Learning
[Study Groups Competition App]() (under construction).

## Scientific Papers
The [Scientific Purpose Web Harvester](http://85.214.28.167:5001/) supports you when it comes to literature research and gives you the chance to draft / generate question and answer pairs for a specific topic automatically. The SCP is also recommended in [DHBW-Wissenschaftliche-Arbeiten](https://github.com/michael-spengler/DHBW-Wissenschaftliche-Arbeiten/blob/main/README.md). If you want to improve the SCP, you can find the repository [here](https://github.com/SimonScapan/scientific-purpose-harvester).


## Contribute
The quality of most of the mentioned DHBW Learning Apps is mainly influenced by the quality of the underlying [training data](https://github.com/michael-spengler/DHBW-Learning-Apps/blob/main/training-data.md).  
Every lecturer is invited to 
1. Fork this repository  
2. Optimize the [training data](https://github.com/michael-spengler/DHBW-Learning-Apps/blob/main/training-data.md) 
3. Raise a Pull Request to ensure the changes come back to this main DHBW training data repository
  
The plan is to have one [training data file](https://github.com/michael-spengler/DHBW-Learning-Apps/blob/main/training-data.md) across several study paths to support interdisciplinary exploration and collaboration. 

If there are however good reasons to split the information into several training data files (e.g. performance reasons reg. the NLP training...) we could also do so. 

## Roadmap
### Holistic Data Adapter
A holistic data adapter could transform trainingdata from and to the DHBW Learning Apps format (which is basically a list of question and answer pairs). This could be beneficial in order to improve the interoperability with other Open Source Learning Applications.

### Audio Chatbot
Maybe this could be a part of the lecture series for WWI20DSA - 'Web-Programmierung (15.11.2021 - 11.02.2022, 3. Semester).
